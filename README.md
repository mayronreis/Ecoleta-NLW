## About 
It is an application that aims to help people find collection points efficiently. Collection points can be registered, so that the type of material to be collected is informed and it can be found in a simple way.

The basis of this application was developed during the Next Level Week offered by RocketSeat (https://rocketseat.com.br/).

## Challenges
Developing an application, going through Api, web and mobile development is already an interesting challenge.

The development challenges started when I had no idea how to integrate three different parts of development (Api, Web, Mobile). During NLW I was able to understand well how it works and to understand the concepts that make everything work in a simple and effective way.

Connecting to external Api's was also a challenge, I didn't have much practice and I didn't understand how this connection was made. During NLW this became easy and I was able to understand how the whole process works.

Another major challenge was to focus on the content covered for a week. Having the discipline to dedicate part of the day to learn new technologies was undoubtedly a big challenge.

## Motivation
What motivated me in this project was the challenge of learning new technologies and new concepts in a short time. A week to make a complete application instigated me a lot.

The technologies covered are the ones I study the most today and always wanting to learn more each day is without a doubt one of the biggest motivations for me.
